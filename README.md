# SimVascular-pythondemos

The scripts in this repository are demos and examples for how to use the [SimVascular](https://github.com/SimVascular/SimVascular/) Python extensibility API, which allows the end user to write scripts to automate repetive tasks within the GUI as well as implement new functionality that isn't yet present in the GUI.
